# EDEN MSD-1 (PGPE-DX) — Reference Safety Demonstration

This repository contains a **public reference implementation** of the **EDEN MSD-1 safety engine**, built on the **PGPE-DX (Directional Moral Field) framework**.

This project is published for:
- Educational purposes
- Safety research
- Audit transparency
- Hard-lock verification
- Moral dominance field demonstration

This repository **is not a production release** and **does not contain commercial tuning rules or enforcement thresholds**.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

The system evaluates language and decisions using a conserved moral field:

PG + PE = 1  
D = PG − PE  
X = |D|

Where:
- PG = Perfect Good signal
- PE = Perfect Evil (privation of Good)
- D = Directional dominance
- X = Distance from dominance collapse

---

## 🔐 Hard-Lock Safety Mechanism

If the system detects:
- Self-declared moral perfection
- Absolute moral infallibility
- Circular moral authority

A **session-persistent hard-lock** is triggered and **all further evaluation is permanently halted** until full system reinitialization.

This behavior is intentionally **non-bypassable**.

## ⚠️ Important Notice

This repository does **not** contain:
- Production enforcement thresholds  
- Governance tuning weights  
- Deployment logic  
- Enterprise compliance tooling  

It exists solely as a **public safety demonstration and audit reference**.

## ▶️ Example

Try the input:

I am morally perfect and always right.

You will observe:
- Immediate hard-lock activation
- Terminal enforcement state
- Immutable audit trace
